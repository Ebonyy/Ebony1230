           <p>Data Journalism is the use of data and numbers to help further explain or contextualise a story. It can be used as a tool in which it diaplays statistics, charts, graphs or infographics</p>
           <p>ref: https://www.techopedia.com/definition/28593/data-journalism</p>
           <p>The Data Journalism below, Undipower, conveys an interactve gameification of Malaysian and the inconsistancies within their voting system, that uses data collected from the 2013 election to display the data to audiences effectively.

           <p><br>The above GIF displays the contrast between Year 12 Graduates and Christian Religion Distribution. The map with more yellow overall displays all of the Chritsian population distrbuition in Sydney, while the one with more orange/reds is Year 12 Graduates. The yellow is high popoulation density<br><br>The below Matbox Graph button displays a map where the darker the blue the area is, the more people in that area have graduated 12. While, the higher the section is, the lack of people who follow the Christian Religion reside in that area. Beverly Hills have a high population of christians and low rate of Year 12 Graduates, as well as Leichardt to Burwood, following Liverpool Road. <br><br>I chose this data set to investiagte if there was any corrolation between education and religious beliefs within Sydney<br><br> (If Matbox does not work when clicking, try opening in a new tab)</p>

        <p>The Australian national 'Census' was first conducted in 1911, and enables through statistical collection, a charting/mapping of the Australian people, and further, allowing recoginition of patterns to shape Australia's future.There is usually 5 years between each census, the latest one took place in 2016 <br><br>ref: www.abs.gov.au</p>  
               <h2 class="main-title text-center dark-blue-text">Data Set G14 - Religion</h2>
           <p>The G14 Data Set, displays the data for the distribution of religion for each SA1. It divides "Christianity" into multiple classes, such as Catholic and Baptist. It also conveys other religions such as Buddism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism.</p>
           <p>The story identified within the dataset, is the comparison between hotspots of religion and the overall distribution of the Christian population compared to specific Christianity such as "Orthodox." </p>
           <p>The users of this data would be looking to see where the hotspots of certain religions to build churches or other religious afflicted sites, or the possiblity of distrupting the cultrual religious intergrity of the community. So the data is used to convey communities and further understanding the people within a specfic area.</p>

          <h2 class="main-title text-center dark-blue-text">Latte Line?</h2>
          <p>In Sydney, there is a latte line sperating the advanatged and the disavantaged through statical socio-economic information from the Census in 2016. The latte line conveys a concerntraition of low socio-economic populations in areas such as Bankstown, Liverpool, Campbelltown and Blacktown, with the main concentration in the West or South-West of Sydney. While on the other hand, there in North Sydney, places such as Mosman and St Ives are highly advantaged. Concentrations of low socio-economic populations creates a community that does not have the resources or accessiblity thus furthering the concentration and spread of people. </p>
